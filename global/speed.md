# Performance

The speed of your online store is important for several reasons. It impacts the shopping experience of your customers, your conversion rate, and your store's discoverability. A faster loading store is generally preferred to a slower one, and search engines often give ranking preference to faster loading sites. 

However, it's important to note that even some of the highest ranked, most successful stores may have relatively low page speed scores. A fast loading store does not necessarily equate to a successful store, and a slower loading store does not guarantee an unsuccessful one. It's important to strike a balance between speed and a good user experience, as too much focus on speed may sacrifice elements that are important for driving sales. Instead, it's best to take a holistic approach to page loading speeds and consider the overall user experience.

### Is my theme making my store slow?
It's not accurate to say that your theme is the sole cause of slow performance for your store. 

There are many factors that contribute to the overall performance of an online store, including the theme code, scripts, apps, images, videos, carousels, social media feeds, and analytics. These assets come from a variety of sources, including theme developers, app developers, and Shopify itself. 

All themes in the Shopify theme store undergo optimization and testing to ensure they are as fast as possible. However, it's important to note that there are limits to what theme developers can do to improve the speed of a store in the short term.

In our experience, apps are often the biggest contributor to slow performance. Installing too many apps can significantly decrease a store's page speed score. 

This doesn't mean you should necessarily uninstall all of your apps. It's important to consider the value that each app brings to your store, such as driving conversions or providing essential functionality.

If you have an app that is slow loading but brings in a lot of conversions, it may make sense to work with the app developer to try to improve the loading speed. On the other hand, if you have an app that is not critical to your business, it may make sense to consider removing it to improve performance. 

As a general rule, it's a good idea to keep the number of apps installed on your store to a minimum, especially if speed is a priority.


### What are good scores?
It's difficult to say exactly what constitutes a "good" score, as it depends on a variety of factors such as the content and number of apps on your store. A store with many images, videos, and sections is likely to have a lower score than a simple text-based page. However, as a general rule, scores in the following ranges are generally sufficient to ensure good performance:

- If you are using apps: a score between 20-30 on mobile and between 30-40 on desktop is a good target. Keep in mind that the more apps you use, the lower your score is likely to be. It's not unusual to have a score in the range of 5-10 if you are using a very high number of apps.

- If you are not using any apps: a score between 50-70 on mobile and between 45-70 on desktop is a good target.

Ultimately, the most important thing is to ensure that your store feels fast and responsive to users. Google and other search engines will generally only penalize stores that are abnormally slow. If your store feels fast to you, it's likely fast enough for most users.


## How to optimize your store for performance
Performance is important for any online store, as customers expect fast and responsive websites. That's why many merchants use tools like Google PageSpeed to assess the performance of their stores. Recently, Shopify has also introduced a built-in performance tool that gives merchants a score.

While the theme itself is not usually the cause of slow performance, All OpenThinking themes are being developed with performance in mind and optimized for speed and convertion. It's still important to follow best practices to maintain good performance. Here are a few tips to keep your store running smoothly:

- Optimize your images before uploading them to your store. Large, unoptimized images can slow down your site.
99% of the time, the only performance issue you should be concerned with is images. Make sure to optimize your images before uploading them to Shopify. If you already have a large number of images in your store, you could try an app like Crush Pics.

- Be mindful of the number and size of images and videos you use. Too many large images and videos can impact performance.

- Regularly audit and remove any unnecessary apps that you're not using. These apps can add code to your site, which will slow it down.

- Limit the number of apps you use, especially those that affect the storefront. Aim for no more than three apps that impact the storefront.

- If you need to uninstall an app, make sure to reach out to the app developer and ask about any extra cleanup processes. Some apps may leave behind code, known as "dead code," that can accumulate and impact performance over time.

- Consider the impact of certain features on performance, such as the dynamic checkout button, which allows customers to buy with a single click from the product page.

- Be mindful of the content and layout of your pages. A large number of products and sections on your homepage can slow down the page generation process and impact performance. Aim for 4-6 sections on your homepage for a good balance.

Finally, don't spend too much time obsessing over performance. As long as you follow these tips, your store should be running smoothly. It's important to prioritize the overall user experience and ensure that your store feels fast and responsive to customers.
